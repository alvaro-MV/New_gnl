Introduction

   X11R7.7(TM), a freely redistributable open-source
   implementation of the X Window System from the X.Org
   Foundation, has been ported to Darwin and Mac OS X.

   Most of the current work on X for Darwin and Mac OS X is
   centered around the XQuartz Project at MacOSforge. If you are
   interested in up-to-date status, want to report a bug, or are
   interested in working on X11 for Darwin, stop by the project
